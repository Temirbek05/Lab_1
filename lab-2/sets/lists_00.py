"""
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

Lists are created using square brackets:


"""

# to create a List 

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)

# Using the list() constructor to make a List:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)

# String, int and boolean data types:

list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]
list3 = [True, False, False]

# To determine how many items a list has, use the len() function:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(len(thislist))
